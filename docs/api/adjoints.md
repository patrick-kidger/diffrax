# Adjoints

There are multiple ways to backpropagate through a differential equation (to compute the gradient of the solution with respect to its initial condition and any parameters).

    Why are there multiple ways of backpropagating through a differential equation? Suppose we are given an ODE

    $\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}t} = f(t, y(t))$

    on $[t_0, t_1]$, with initial condition $y(0) = y_0$. So $y(t)$ is the (unknown) exact solution, to which we will compute some numerical approxiation $y_N \approx y(t_1)$.

    We may directly apply autodifferentiation to calculate $\frac{\mathrm{d}y_N}{\mathrm{d}y_0}$, by backpropagating through the internals of the solver. This is known a "discretise then optimise", is the default in Diffrax, and corresponds to [`diffrax.RecursiveCheckpointAdjoint`][] below.

    Alternatively we may compute $\frac{\mathrm{d}y(t_1)}{\mathrm{d}y_0}$ analytically. In doing so we obtain a backwards-in-time ODE that we must numerically solve to obtain the desired gradients. This is known as "optimise then discretise", and corresponds to [`diffrax.BacksolveAdjoint`][] below.
