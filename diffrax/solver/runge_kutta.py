    # Example!
    #
    # Consider a Butcher tableau:
    #
    # c1 | a11 a12 a13 a14
    # c2 | a21 a22 a23 a24
    # c3 | a31 a32 a33 a34
    # c4 | a41 a42 a43 a44
    # ---+----------------
    #    |  b1  b2  b3  b4
    #    |  β1  β2  β3  β4
    #
    # Let y0 be the input to the step, and let y1 denote the output of the step.
    #
    # Then the output is computed via
    # y1 = y0 + Σ_i bi ki
    # where ki = fi dt   (in the case of an ODE -- it is "fi dW" etc. for an SDE)
    # and fi = f(ci, zi)
    # and zi = y0 + Σ_j aij kj
    #
    # Note that "stage" may be used to refer to any of ki, fi, or zi.
    #
    # The error estimate is given by
    # err = Σ_i βi ki
    # (I.e. it is compute directly -- *not* as the difference of two solutions.)
    #
    # ---
    #
    # To encoder the above tableau in Diffrax, you would take:
    # c = np.array([c2, c3, c4])

ButcherTableau.__init__.__doc__ = """**Arguments:**

Let `k` denote the number of stages of the solver.

- `a_lower`: the lower triangle (without the diagonal) of the Butcher tableau. Should
    be a tuple of NumPy arrays, corresponding to the rows of this lower triangle. The
    first array represents the should be of shape `(1,)`. Each subsequent array should
    be of shape `(2,)`, `(3,)` etc. The final array should have shape `(k - 1,)`.
- `b_sol`: the linear combination of stages to take to produce the output at each step.
    Should be a NumPy array of shape `(k,)`.
- `b_error`: the linear combination of stages to take to produce the error estimate at
    each step. Should be a NumPy array of shape `(k,)`. Note that this is *not*
    differenced against `b_sol` prior to evaluation. (i.e. `b_error` gives the linear
    combination for producing the error estimate directly, not for producing some
    alternate solution that is compared against the main solution).
- `c`: the time increments used in the Butcher tableau.
- `a_diagonal`: optional. The diagonal of the Butcher tableau. Should be `None` or a
    NumPy array of shape `(k,)`. Used for diagonal implicit Runge--Kutta methods only.
- `a_predictor`: optional. Used in a similar way to `a_lower`; specifies the linear
    combination of previous stages to use as a predictor for the solution to the
    implicit problem at that stage. See
    [the developer documentation](../../devdocs/predictor_dirk). Used for diagonal
    implicit Runge--Kutta methods only.

Whether the solver exhibits either the FSAL or SSAL properties is determined
automatically.

        # - Explicit Runge--Kutta methods (ERK)
        # - Diagonal Implicit Runge--Kutta methods (DIRK)
        # - Singular Diagonal Implicit Runge--Kutta methods (SDIRK)

        # In all cases it can handle applications to both ODEs and SDEs.
        # Several of these are implicit methods. The latter two are multi-tableau
        # methods.
        #
        # Both ODEs and SDEs: this is the usual innovation with Diffrax. We treat
        # everything as a CDE against an arbitrary control. This also means we have a
        # distinction between f-space (vector field values) and k-space
        # ((vector field)-control products).
        #
        # Implicit methods: these all involve computing a Jacobian somewhere, and doing
        # a root find. Any root finder can be used, although in practice the chord
        # method is typical. Indeed it is common (SDIRK; ESDIRK) to reuse the Jacobian
        # between stages.
        #
        # Multi-tableau methods: these are cases where each term has a different
        # tableau, and their stages are interleaved. This means that the y-value at
        # which we evaluate each stage depends on the previous stages of all tableaus.
        # Note that these shouldn't be confused with splitting methods, where typically
        # we solve one term using one solver, and then another term using another
        # solver, without interleaving the stages. (Splitting methods instead interleave
        # steps.)
        #
        # The other main innovation here (besides the unification of all these different
        # solvers) is a JAX-specific thing: getting all of these to compile efficiently,
        # with some tricks to trace through the vector field as few times as possible.
        #

        # also autovectorisable and autodifferentiable.

        # The first most important case is if evaluating the vector field is expensive.
        # The canonical example is solving optimise-then-discretise adjoint SDEs, for
        # which the diffusion term takes the form (dg/dy)dW, which is a vjp against the
        # control. This can be done most efficiently by never materialising the full
        # diffusion matrix (the Jacobian dg/dy): don't call `vf`, and instead work
        # directly with `vf_prod`.
        # Cases of this nature are communicated via the `vf_expensive` flag. (Which
        # in Diffrax by default is applied to all AdjointTerms with vector controls.)

        #
        # If we don't hit the above case, we consider FSAL.
        # For any FSAL solver, we must evaluate `vf`: we need the final `f1` to pass to
        # the next step. (The control changes from step-to-step, so we cannot simply
        # pass `k1`.)
        # In addition if the solver has an implicit tableau, then we must store `fs`.
        # This is because to get the final f1, we need to do the implicit solve in
        # f-space, which means we need to store fs to predict the initial point for the
        # root finding operation.
        # - Verdict: eval_fs=True, store_fs=True.
        # If the solver is explicit-only, then we can store either. We choose to store
        # ks instead, as this is perhaps slightly more efficient: other downstream tasks
        # like error estimates and dense information use ks rather than fs.
        # - Verdict: eval_fs=True, store_fs=False
        #
        # For all other cases, we don't have any hard restrictions. It *may* be the case

        # control is a vector: it's usually cheaper to do `A @ (B @ dx)` rather than
        # `(A @ B) @ dx`.) Moreover downstream tasks like error estimatess and dense
