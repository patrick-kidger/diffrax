        # A couple of final notes:
        #
        # - Note how contract over j1 and j2 simultaneously. This is directly analogous
        #   to the task of computing trace(AB), which in Einstein notation is
        #   A_{i j} B_{j k} δ_{i k}. If would be tempting to compute this by doing a
        #   matrix-matrix product AB, and then taking a trace. But that involves
        #   materialising all of AB, just so we can ignore most of it and sum the
        #   diagonal.
        #   Rewriting the Einstein notation as A_{i j} B_{j i}, we see a more efficient
        #   way of computing this quantity: by doing an element-wise multiplication of
        #   A against B-transpose, and then summing every entry.
        #   Moral of the story: if the summation indices in a tensor network form a
        #   cycle, then you're doing something trace-like, and should try and contract
        #   over two indices at the same time.
        #   In this case, we contract over j1 and j2 simultaneously, between
        #   ΔwΔw_{j1 j2} and g0_{k j1} g0_{i j2, k}.
        #
        # - Note that in the overall expression g0_{k j1} g0_{i j2, k} ΔwΔw_{j1 j2},
        #   we have summation indices j1, j2, k. If we were to have contracted down j1
        #   or j2 too first, then we couldn't have pulled the double-contraction trick
        #   discussed in the first bullet point. This is because we'd have a
        #   contraction against a "top" and a "bottom" index in the Jacobian
        #   g0_{i j2, k}. We can do the former as a VJP and the latter as JVP, but we
        #   can't do both at the same time without materialising the full Jacobian.
        #   In other words, we could only do a double-contraction over (j1, j2), but
        #   not (j1, k) or (j2, k), and this is why we contract over k first.
        #
        # - Note that in those expressions featuring two lots of Δw-like-structure,
        #   that we never try to distinguish one Δw-like-structure from the other
        #   Δw-like-structure. This is because ΔwΔw is symmetric.
