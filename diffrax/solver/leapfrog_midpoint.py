# TODO: support arbitrary linear multistep methods
class LeapfrogMidpoint(AbstractSolver):
    r"""Leapfrog/midpoint method.

    2nd order linear multistep method.

    Note that this is referred to as the "leapfrog/midpoint method" as this is the name
    used by Shampine in the reference below. It should not be confused with any of the
    many other "leapfrog methods" (there are several), or with the "midpoint method"
    (which is usually taken to refer to the explicit Runge--Kutta method
    [`diffrax.Midpoint`][]).
