def bounded_while_loop(cond_fun, body_fun, init_val, max_steps, base=16):
    """Reverse-mode autodifferentiable while loop.

    Mostly as `lax.while_loop`, with a few small changes.

    Arguments:
        cond_fun: function `a -> a`
        body_fun: function `a -> b -> a`, where `b` is a function that should be used
            instead of performing in-place updates with .at[].set() etc; see below.
        init_val: pytree with structure `a`.
        max_steps: integer or `None`.
        base: integer.

    Limitations with in-place updates.:
        The single big limitation is around making in-place updates. Done naively then
        the XLA compiler will fail to treat these as in-place and will make a copy
        every time. (See JAX issue #8192.)

        Working around this is a bit of a hassle -- as follows -- and it is for this
        reason that `body_fun` takes a second argument.

        If you ever have:
        - an inplace update...
        - ...made to the input to the body_fun...
        - ...whose result is returned from the body_fun...
        ...then you should use

        ```python
        x = inplace(x).at[i].set(u)
        x = HadInplaceUpdate(x)
        ```

        in place of

        ```python
        x = x.at[i].set(u)
        ```

        where `inplace` is the second argument to `body_fun`, and `HadInplaceUpdate` is
        available at `diffrax.misc.HadInplaceUpdate`.

        Internally, `bounded_while_loop` will treat things so as to work around this
        limitation of XLA.

        !!! faq

            `HadInplaceUpdate` is available separately (instead of being returned
            automatically from `inplace().at[].set()`) in case the in-place update
            takes place inside e.g. a `lax.scan` or similar, and you need to maintain
            PyTree structures. Just place the `HadInplaceUpdate` at the very end of
            `body_fun`. (And applied only to those array(s) that actually had in-place
            update(s), if the state is a PyTree.)

        !!! note

            If you need to nest `bounded_while_loop`s, then the two `inplace` functions
            can be merged:

            ```python
            def body_fun(val, inplace):
                ...  # stuff (use inplace)

                def inner_body_fun(_val, _inplace):
                    _inplace = _inplace.merge(inplace)
                    ...  # stuff (use _inplace)

                bounded_while_loop(body_fun=inner_body_fun, ...)

                ... # stuff (use inplace)

            bounded_while_loop(body_fun=body_fun, ...)
            ```

        !!! note

            In-place updates to arrays that are _created_ inside of `body_fun` can be
            made as normal. It's just those arrays that are part of the state (that is
            passed in and out) that need to be treated specially.

    Note the extra `max_steps` argument. If this is `None` then `bounded_while_loop`
    will fall back to `lax.while_loop` (which is not reverse-mode autodifferentiable).
    If it is a non-negative integer then this is the maximum number of steps which may
    be taken in the loop, after which the loop will exit unconditionally.

    Note the extra `base` argument.
    - Run time will increase slightly as `base` increases.
    - Compilation time will decrease substantially as
      `math.ceil(math.log(max_steps, base))` decreases. (Which happens as `base`
      increases.)

# There's several tricks happening here to work around various limitations of JAX.
# (Also see https://github.com/google/jax/issues/2139#issuecomment-1039293633)
# 1. `unvmap_any` prior to using `lax.cond`. JAX has a problem in that vmap-of-cond
#    is converted to a `lax.select`, which executes both branches unconditionally.
#    Thus writing this naively, using a plain `lax.cond`, will mean the loop always
#    runs to `max_steps` when executing under vmap. Instead we run (only) until every
#    batch element has finished.
# 2. Treating in-place updates specially in the body_fun. Specifically we need to
#    `lax.select` the update-to-make, not the updated buffer. This is because the
#    latter instead results in XLA:CPU failing to determine that the buffer can be
#    updated in-place, and instead it makes a copy. c.f. JAX issue #8192.
#    This is done through the extra `inplace` argument provided to `body_fun`.
# 3. The use of the `@jax.checkpoint` decorator. Backpropagating through a
#    `bounded_while_loop` will otherwise run in θ(max_steps) time, rather than
#    θ(number of steps actually taken). See
#    https://docs.kidger.site/diffrax/devdocs/bounded_while_loop/
# 4. The use of `base`. In theory `base=2` is optimal at run time, as it implies the
#    fewest superfluous operations. In practice this implies quite deep recursion in
#    the construction of the bounded while loop, and this slows down the jaxpr
#    creation and the XLA compilation. We choose `base=16` as a reasonable-looking
#    compromise between compilation time and run time.
