    """Brownian simulation that is only suitable for certain cases.

    This is a very quick way to simulate Brownian motion, but can only be used when all
    of the following are true:

    1. You are using a fixed step size controller. (Not an adaptive one.)

    2. You do not need to backpropagate through the differential equation.

    3. You do not need deterministic solutions with respect to `key`. (This
       implementation will produce different results based on fluctuations in
       floating-point arithmetic.)

    Internally this operates by just sampling a fresh normal random variable over every
    interval, ignoring the correlation between samples exhibited in true Brownian
    motion. Hence the restrictions above. (They describe the general case for which the
    correlation structure isn't needed.)

    Depending on the `levy_area` argument, this can also be used to generate Levy area.

    be a tuple of integers, describing the shape of a single JAX array. In that case

- `key`: A random key.
- `levy_area`: Whether to additionally generate Levy area. This is required by some SDE
