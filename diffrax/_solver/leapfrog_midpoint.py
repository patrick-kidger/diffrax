# TODO: support arbitrary linear multistep methods
class LeapfrogMidpoint(AbstractReversibleSolver):
    r"""Leapfrog/midpoint method.

    2nd order linear multistep method. Uses 1st order local linear interpolation for
    dense/ts output.

    Note that this is referred to as the "leapfrog/midpoint method" as this is the name
    used by Shampine in the reference below. It should not be confused with any of the
    many other "leapfrog methods" (there are several), or with the "midpoint method"
    (which is usually taken to refer to the explicit Runge--Kutta method
    [`diffrax.Midpoint`][]).

    !!! note
        This solver is algebraically reversible, meaning that the state at `t0` can be
        reconstructed (in closed form) from the state at `t1`. This allows exact
        gradient backpropagation in $O(n)$ time and $O(1)$ memory when using
        [`diffrax.ReversibleAdjoint`][].
