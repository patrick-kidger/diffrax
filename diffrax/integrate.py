    """Solves a differential equation.

    This function is the main entry point for solving all kinds of initial value
    problems, whether they are ODEs, SDEs, or CDEs.

    The differential equation is integrated from `t0` to `t1`.

    See the [Getting started](../usage/getting-started.md) page for example usage.

    **Main arguments:**

    These are the arguments most commonly used day-to-day.

    - `terms`: The terms of the differential equation. This specifies the vector field.
        (For non-ordinary differential equations (SDEs, CDEs), this also specifies the
        Brownian motion or the control.)
    - `solver`: The solver for the differential equation. See the guide on [how to
        choose a solver](../usage/how-to-choose-a-solver.md).
    - `t0`: The start of the region of integration.
    - `t1`: The end of the region of integration.
    - `dt0`: The step size to use for the first step. If using fixed step sizes then
        this will also be the step size for all other steps. (Except the last one,
        which may be slightly smaller and clipped to `t1`.) If set as `None` then the
        initial step size will be determined automatically if possible.
    - `y0`: The initial value. This can be any PyTree of JAX arrays. (Or types that
        can be coerced to JAX arrays, like Python floats.)
    - `args`: Any additional arguments to pass to the vector field.
    - `saveat`: What times to save the solution of the differential equation. See
        [`diffrax.SaveAt`][]. Defaults to just the last time `t1`. (Keyword-only
        argument.)
    - `stepsize_controller`: How to change the step size as the integration progresses.
        See the [list of stepsize controllers](../api/stepsize_controller.md).
        Defaults to using a fixed constant step size. (Keyword-only argument.)

    **Other arguments:**

    These arguments are infrequently used, and for most purposes you shouldn't need to
    understand these. All of these are keyword-only arguments.

    - `adjoint`: How to backpropagate (and compute forward-mode autoderivatives) of
        `diffeqsolve`. Defaults to discretise-then-optimise, which is usually the best
        option for most problems. See the page on [Adjoints](./adjoints.md) for more
        information.

    - `discrete_terminating_event`: A discrete event at which to terminate the solve
        early. See the page on [Events](./events.md) for more information.

    - `max_steps`: The maximum number of steps to take before quitting the computation
        unconditionally.

        Can also be set to `None` to allow an arbitrary number of steps, although this
        is incompatible with `saveat=SaveAt(steps=True)` or `saveat=SaveAt(dense=True)`,
        and can only be backpropagated through if using `adjoint=BacksolveAdjoint()` or
        `adjoint=ImplicitAdjoint()`.

        Note that (a) compile times; and (b) backpropagation run times; will increase
        as `max_steps` increases. (Specifically, each time `max_steps` passes a power
        of 16.) You can reduce these times by using the smallest value of `max_steps`
        that is reasonable for your problem.

    - `throw`: Whether to raise an exception if the integration fails for any reason.

        If `True` then an integration failure will raise an error. Note that the errors
        are only reliably raised on CPUs. If on GPUs then the error may only be
        printed to stderr, whilst on TPUs then the behaviour is undefined.

        If `False` then the returned solution object will have a `result` field
        indicating whether any failures occurred.

        Possible failures include for example hitting `max_steps`, or the problem
        becoming too stiff to integrate. (For most purposes these failures are
        unusual.)

        !!! note

            Note that when `jax.vmap`-ing a differential equation solve, then
            `throw=True` means that an exception will be raised if any batch element
            fails. You may prefer to set `throw=False` and inspect the `result` field
            of the returned solution object, to determine which batch elements
            succeeded and which failed.

    - `solver_state`: Some initial state for the solver. Generally obtained by
        `SaveAt(solver_state=True)` from a previous solve.

    - `controller_state`: Some initial state for the step size controller. Generally
        obtained by `SaveAt(controller_state=True)` from a previous solve.

    - `made_jump`: Whether a jump has just been made at `t0`. Used to update
        `solver_state` (if passed). Generally obtained by `SaveAt(made_jump=True)`
        from a previous solve.

    **Returns:**

    Returns a [`diffrax.Solution`][] object specifying the solution to the differential
    equation.

    **Raises:**

    - `ValueError` for bad inputs.
    - `RuntimeError` if `throw=True` and the integration fails (e.g. hitting the
        maximum number of steps).

    !!! note

        It is possible to have `t1 < t0`, in which case integration proceeds backwards
        in time.
