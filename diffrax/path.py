class AbstractPath(eqx.Module):
    """Abstract base class for all paths.

    Every path has a start point `t0` and an end point `t1`. In between these values
    it is possible to `evaluate` the path, or (if it is differentiable, e.g. not
    Brownian motion) calculate its `derivative`.

        class QuadraticPath(AbstractPath):
            @property
            def t0(self):

        **Arguments:**

        - `t0`: Any point in $[t_0, t_1]$ to evaluate the path at.
        - `t1`: If passed, then the increment from `t1` to `t0` is evaluated instead.
        - `left`: Across jump points: whether to treat the path as left-continuous
            or right-continuous.

        !!! faq "FAQ"

            Note that we use $t_0$ and $t_1$ to refer to the overall interval, as
            obtained via `instance.t0` and `instance.t1`. We use `t0` and `t1` to refer
            to some subinterval of $[t_0, t_1]$. This is an API that is used for
            consistency with the rest of the package, and just happens to be a little
            confusing here.

        **Returns:**

        If `t1` is not passed:

        The value of the path at `t0`.

        If `t1` is passed:

        The increment of the path between `t0` and `t1`.

        to `jax.jvp(self.evaluate, (t,), (jnp.ones_like(t),))` (and indeed this is its

        **Arguments:**

        - `t`: Any point in $[t_0, t_1]$ to evaluate the derivative at.
        - `left`: Whether to obtain the left-derivative or right-derivative at that
            point.
