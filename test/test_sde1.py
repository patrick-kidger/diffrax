# For solvers of high order, comparing to Euler or Heun is not sufficient,
# because they are substantially worse than e.g. ShARK. ShARK is more precise
# at dt=2**-4 than Euler is at dt=2**-14 (and it takes forever to run at such
# a small dt). Hence , the order of convergence of ShARK seems to plateau at
# discretisations finer than 2**-4.
# Therefore, we use two separate tests. First we determine how fast the solver
# converges to its own limit (i.e. using itself as reference), and then in a
# different test check whether that limit is the same as the Euler/Heun limit.
